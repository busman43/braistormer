# Brainstorming Engine

A Vite + React + TypeScript app that asks exactly 3 clarifying questions and then generates categorized idea sets with top picks, variations, and follow-up prompts.

Now includes an **Idea Archive Agent** that scopes each run, retrieves unique ideas, and stores them in an archive for future suggestion cycles.
